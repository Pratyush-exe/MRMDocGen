    "public_info": "The Credit Line Decrease (CLD) model is used to identify high risks accounts with\nthe objective to mitigate potential losses by decreasing their credit limit. The\nmodel will be used on all the RRB credit card customers.\nRRB branded credit card is a core product of RRB and accounts for ~$90 million\nANR with ~20 million open accounts till Dec\u201922.\nThe model has been built using Dec 2018 development vintage. February 2018\nand April 2019 has been used for out-of-time (OOT) validations. The model has\nbeen built on entire card customers except for the customers whose past 12\nmonths historical data is not known.\nThe model estimates the likelihood of an account having a status of 60+ days\npast due at the end of 18 months (classified as \u2018bad\u2019 hereafter in this document).\nThe model has been built on both internal as well as external data. The external\ncredit bureau data is received monthly through a batch process for the Existing\nCard Members (ECM). In addition, the model leverages daily data \u2013 daily\nbureau (in addition to batch bureau), daily triggers and a few daily on-us\nattributes \u2013 to allow the identification of high risk accounts before they utilize the\nremaining open-to-buy amount.",
    "assumptions": "The model uses performance definition of \u2018Bucket 3+ at the end of 18 months\u2019.\nThis definition has been obtained on the basis of a business analysis conducted\nwith a terminal window of 24 months. A greater emphasis has been made on\nkeeping the false positive rate lower given that Credit Line Decrease is a\nnegative action to a customer. The business analysis is also supported by\nstatistical analysis on the choice of target variable definition. In addition,\nforbearance, re-age and settlements in 18 months has been classified as bads.\nTo minimize overlap between Good/Bad characteristics, \u2018indeterminate has\nbeen assigned in the model development. Accounts with Bucket 2 at the end of\nperformance window has been tagged as \u2018indeterminate\u2019 as accounts have\nhigher false positive rate (~50%), but belongs to a negative segment.",
    "assumptions_reasons": "Based on the last annual model review exercise, MRR (Model Risk Rating) of the\nmodel is high. Hence, monitoring frequency of the model is Quarterly.\nAll the model performance metrics defined by MRM for consumer valuation\nmodel are monitored based on the frequency defined by MRM to ensure the\nrobustness of the model"
